# monome-mods
alternate firmwares for monome eurorack modules and other monome mods

for more info including  toolchain set up and how to flash firmware see http://monome.org/docs/modular

you'll need the monome skeleton library, get it here: https://github.com/tehn/mod  
put it in the same folder where your monome-mods folder is (so rootfolder\mod and rootfolder\monome-mods)
